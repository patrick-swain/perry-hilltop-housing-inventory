# perry-hilltop-housing-inventory
A comprehensive and replicable housing inventory for the neighborhoods of Perry South and Fineview.

Purpose:
This project's primary objective is to create a comprehensive, detailed, and replicable master property inventory for the Perry Hilltop Fineview Citizens Council (PHFCC). This inventory serves as a foundational dataset to guide strategic decision-making, identify properties of interest, and analyze housing trends to support the preservation and development of affordable housing opportunities within the community.
Scope:
Geographic Boundaries: The inventory includes all property parcels located within the official boundaries of the Fineview and Perry South neighborhoods of Pittsburgh.
Dataset Contents: The final inventory contains 3,416 properties. Each property is enriched with 60 data fields covering ownership, physical characteristics, tax assessment, sales history, financial indicators, and more.
Methodology: The inventory was created using a replicable, programmatic approach. A base file containing all properties was generated from a property assessment file downloaded from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. This base file was then appended with additional data from specialized datasets using a custom Python script. This ensures that the inventory can be updated or recreated as new data becomes available.
Analysis:
Aging Housing Stock: The neighborhoods are characterized by an old housing stock, with a typical home being 110 years old and over 80% built before 1940. This age is strongly correlated with poorer property conditions, suggesting widespread maintenance and code-related challenges.
Accelerating Market Pressure: The sales market has seen dramatic price appreciation over the last decade, with median prices often doubling or tripling. Properties are now consistently selling for 50% or more above their assessed value, signaling intense market heat that threatens housing affordability and increases the incentive for property "flipping."
Concentrated Distress Tied to Ownership and Occupancy: Non-owner occupied parcels and some corporate and investor-owned properties, especially those held by absentee landlords outside the neighborhood, are more likely to be in poor condition and have high rates of tax delinquency compared to owner-occupied homes. Geospatial analysis shows that these distressed properties are not random but are often geographically clustered, presenting opportunities for targeted community interventions.
